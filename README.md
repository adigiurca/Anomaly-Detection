# Anomaly Detection using PyOD Framework
This project focuses on detecting anomalies in datasets using three different machine learning techniques: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM), and Lightweight Online Detector of Anomalies (LODA). It is implemented entirely in a Jupyter Notebook and offers a comparative look at how these models perform in identifying unusual or unexpected patterns in the data.

The notebook walks through data loading, preprocessing, anomaly detection using the three algorithms, and finally evaluating the results. To better understand how the models relate to each other and the dataset, performance metrics are visualized using correlation matrices, providing insight into how consistent the models are in their anomaly predictions.

To use the program, open the notebook in Jupyter and follow the cells in order. Make sure the required libraries are installed, including numpy, matplotlib, pandas, sklearn, and pyod (for LODA). Each section is annotated and runs independently, so you can test individual models or all three together.
